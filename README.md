mydotfiles
==========

my configuration files

I broke my environment after trying to symlink the dotfile directory
Not sure what happened but after symlinking the dotfile direcotory vim couldn't find my plugins like NERDTree

Will be working on learning more about my UNIX environment and how to control my $PATH variables
